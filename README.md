# Options Chrome Extension for Robinhood

Retail brokeraging apps have starting adding "return simulators" on options contracts in order for people to visualize future profits or losses.
Some apps, like Robinhood, have very simplified models that only factor in the underlying's price and not other factors like volatility.

This simple Chrome extension is to follow a similar model to this [Options Profit Calculator](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/), which can factor in changes in IV and also provide a good heatmap for profitability.
